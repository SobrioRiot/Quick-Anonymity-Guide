# Quick guide to anonymity on social media
                                             
First of all, we will start this tutorial by talking about online security:

There is more than one way to find out the identity of an online user. 
Through various methods, you can deduce the city, age, name and other relevant information about someone. 
That's why the best way you can really stay safe, is to have a VPN at all times.

Do I need to pay? No; there are several free options that (frankly I don't recommend) can save your neck. 
There are several options to choose from. Personally, I recommend Mullvad. 

If you are looking for a free option, I suggest ProtonVpn which you can configure your connection in a variety of ways. 
You can also try the free trial periods of some services like Nordvpn, Ghostvpn, and others.
 
If you have some computer knowledge, I suggest you take a look at the InviZible Lite app; this application is very useful and free. 

If you prefer other options,  you can visit the website www.jagoanssh.com to use their free VPN for 7 days. 

Depending on the country and political conditions, many of these services may be limited.

# Vpn 

   Let's start by configuring protonvpn. Depending on your device, visit the app store and search for the following "Proton vpn". 
   Once you do so, you will see the following icon appear. Select the app and download it. 
   Keep in mind that I don't know exactly where in the world you are and you may have to use another free vpn. Having said that, 
   this guide will show you how to install any type of vpn; the settings are essentially the same.

   Now, the fist thing we need is to go to out app store and look for "Protonvpn" on the search box

   The next thing to do is to choose your username. This can be something you can write down on a piece of paper and then try to memorize. 
   It is not recommended that you save your passwords with Google’s automatic options. 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110576526/213604336-9f4f21da-8eb0-4880-bcbf-fb28fafffaa8.png" width=85% height=85%>

   Once you have your account ready and you are on the next screen, click on the button in the bottom right corner, the vpn will connect                      automatically.

   I suggest you try the app and choose USA as your country, almost all the apps work there. 
   You will see the screen change colour, confirming that you have connected to the vpn.

# Let's add extra security: 

   Look for the settings on your phone (it usually has a gear icon). 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110576526/213604564-94ffde84-95af-4395-ac1f-432e14706efa.png" width=85% height=85%>

   As you can see, we are in the settings menu, in the search box type "vpn".

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110576526/213604608-4f1782e7-f618-4a7b-b55a-319924698a80.png" width=85% height=85%>

   Then click on the gear icon next to the legend that says "proton vpn".

   Enable the options "Always-on Vpn" and "Block connections without Vpn".

# Great, now we have some protection.

   Next we will check applications - Telegram, Twitter, Facebook, etc. 
   Keep in mind that all information available on the internet is stored for years, so it is more convenient to surf anonymously.

The first thing to do is to create a proton mail account. Visit the website 
> https://account.proton.me/signup

   If you are using your phone, go to your app store and donwload "protonmail"

   1-  Download the app or got to the website and click on sign in 
   2 - Select your preferred email address, your password, and complete the process.

   3 - Go through the tutorial and keep your account open for verification.
   4 - Keep protonmail opened 



# We are almost done!

   The next thing to do is to go to your app shop and search for the "pingme" app.
   It looks just like the following image 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110576526/213606017-670b4350-aa68-4221-833a-06addd41fd6f.png" width=85% height=85%>

   Once downloaded, you can register using an email address, enter the one you just made at protonmail.com. 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110576526/213606083-cc909b94-d682-4a47-8a76-99d1dc0a1af9.png" width=85% height=85%>

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110576526/213606118-8cf96ac2-776b-4866-a632-f78fb6a7172a.png" width=85% height=85%>

   At the end of your registration they will send you an email to verify your account, enter the verification numbers to access the app.
   Here comes the good part, time to verify your apps with anonymous numbers. 
   Once logged in, on the right hand side tab, you will see a button that allows you to top up. At this point you can choose to pay 
   with cryptocurrencies or google pay.

* If you pay with google pay, you can use your bank card or a google pay card.*
* Remember that there are many online sites where you can buy google gift cards.*
* If you prefer to make purchases with cryptocurrencies, I suggest you make a wallet with the platforms that appear in the payment window.*

# Finally, let's choose the service to verify:

   I recommend USA or UK for telegram and Twitter. You can use numbers from Canada and other parts of the world, just be patient, there are not always        numbers available.

# Verification 

   1 - Select the country 
   2- Select the application to verify - Telegram, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc.

   3- Click on Next and now copy the number and phone number in the verification box of the app you want to use.
   4- Wait a few seconds for the code to arrive. If that doesn’t work, try another number until you get the code.

   5- Enter the verification code in the verification box.

Congratulations, now you will have an account that is not linked to your number and you will also be able to surf with peace of mind knowing that your mobile will always be connected to the VPN.
